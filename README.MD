# KRYPTONIAN
This is a standardisation test By learnable of to test us on the Internship we did for the past six months

# INTRODUCTION 
We are meant to build an app that with full authentication and the user has the ability to generate api Key to be used for file upload

# DOCUMENTATION
*Below is a link to the docs to the API*

[docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29102282/2sA3Qy5U4w)

# PROGRAM FLOW
1. A user registers/creates an account
2. An Activation link is sent to the user to make sure the users email is valid
3. The user must use otp before a successful login
4. The user logs in successfully after a successful otp for 2FA
5. user must generate API key to be able to upload image
6. user can now upload image using the api key associated with the user

# DEPLOYMENT 
The API is deployed on render: 

[hostlink](https://kryptonite-2j5p.onrender.com)

# INSTALLATION
1. clone the main branch as there 
2. to install:  

    ```npm install ```

3. Set up your environmental variables by creating .env file 

- PORT=
- MONGO_USERNAME=
- MONGO_PASSWORD=

- SECRET_KEY=''
- EMAIL_USER=
- EMAIL_PASSWORD=
- SERVICE='' 
- MAIL_HOST=''
- MAIL_PORT=


# TASK 
1. File Uploads:
   - All Kryptonians using the Kryptonite App must have API keys.
   - Files can be uploaded using the API key without an auth token.
   - If not already done, Kryptonians must generate an API key to upload files.
   - Uploaded files must be associated with the Kryptonian who owns the API key.
   - Only image files are allowed currently and should be stored as Base64 strings in the database. This is to help images to be shared easily across various AI industries on Krypton, Acamas added.
   - Files should be deleted from the system/app folder after being stored.

2. API Design:
   - Follow RESTful API principles for designing resource endpoints.
   - Implement class-based services and controllers, as preferred by Oluomaâ€™s grandfather.

3. Accessing Images:
   - Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) needs the ability to access all images or a single image without any form of authentication.

4. API Key Design:
   - Kryptonians should be able to invalidate an API key, making it unusable.
   - API keys should be issued once and never shown again to the Kryptonian.
